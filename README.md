## Next

Refreshed on latest Next version w/app folder, very awesome. Vercel deployment pretty legit.

- TypeScript
- NextJS
- Postgres
- Vercel Auto Deploy
- Tailwind (Customize Later)
- SSO


## Todo
- Some of this organization is really messy, really.
- Make SSO
   - Firebase?
- MVP

## Bugs

- Bad port redirect, why?
- Run on 3000, no 3000 in code applied
  - Attempts to reload logged in user to dash on wrong port
